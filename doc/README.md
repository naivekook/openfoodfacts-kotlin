# Documentation (Meta)

## Conventions

> ℹ️ The conventions noted below pertain to this **Open Food Facts Kotlin Multiplatform repository** only. They may not apply to other Open Food Facts resources.

- Documentation is written in standard [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- The structure of documentation is to follow the file structure of the repository
  - Combining this principle with naming each folder's main documentation page as `README.md` has the effect of displaying relevant, browseable documentation for the project in most web-based VCS systems including GitHub.
- Where the documentation for a given folder is more extensive that can be captured in `README.md`, files for broken-out sub-topics should go in a `/doc` sub-folder.
- Any extra, unparented documentation files or assets are to be placed in the repo-root `/doc`
